# Shell
#
# You can set `shell.program` to the path of your favorite shell, e.g. `/bin/fish`.
# Entries in `shell.args` are passed unmodified as arguments to the shell.
#
# Default:
#   - (macOS) user login shell
#   - (Linux/BSD) user login shell
#   - (Windows) powershell
#
# Example 1 using fish shell from bin path:
#
#   shell = { program = "/bin/fish", args = ["--login"] }
#
# Example 2 for Windows using powershell
#
#   shell = { program = "pwsh", args = [] }
#
# Example 3 for Windows using powershell with login
#
#   shell = { program = "pwsh", args = ["-l"] }

# Startup directory
#
# Directory the shell is started in. If this is unset the working
# directory of the parent process will be used.
#
# This configuration only has effect if use-fork is disabled
#
# Example
#  working-dir = "/Users/raphael/Documents/"

# Environment variables
#
# The example below sets fish as the default SHELL using env vars
# please do not copy this if you do not need
#
# Example
#   env-vars = []

# Disable render when unfocused
#
# This property disable renderer processes while Rio is unfocused.
#
# Example
#   disable-renderer-when-unfocused = false

# Use fork
#
# Defaults for POSIX-based systems (Windows is not configurable):
# MacOS: spawn processes
# Linux/BSD: fork processes
#
# Example
#   use-fork = false

# Colors
#
# Colors definition will overwrite any property in theme
# (considering if theme folder does exists and is being used)
#
# Example:
#
#   [colors]
#   background = '#0F0D0E'
#   foreground = '#F9F4DA'
#   cursor = '#F38BA3'
#   tabs = '#443d40'
#   tabs-active = '#F38BA3'
#   green = '#0BA95B'
#   red = '#ED203D'
#   blue = '#12B5E5'
#   yellow = '#FCBA28'

# Bindings
#
# Create custom Key bindings for Rio terminal
# More information in: raphamorim.io/rio/docs/custom-key-bindings
#
# Example
#   [bindings]
#   keys = [
#     { key = "q", with = "super", action = "Quit" },
#     # Bytes[27, 91, 53, 126] is equivalent to "\x1b[5~"
#     { key = "home", with = "super | shift", bytes = [27, 91, 53, 126] }
#   ]

# Log level
#
# This property enables log level filter. Default is "OFF".
#
# Example
#   [developer]
#   log-level = "OFF"
